This folder holds the folders containing tested iterations of the autogenerated files. 
They are are comprised of ...Receive_FSM.cpp files(With the exception of PS_34src) as they're the only portion of the auto-generated code that seems to be modified by a JTS users.
I also added the complete folders of each component for each iteration, these are compiled and can be run.


This README describes the results of the iterations.


Iteration 1
----------------
-The PrimitiveDriverRobot and the PrimServer components exchange messages in an infinite loop as expected.
-The output is interesting as the Linear X and Rotational Z values become -100 after incrementing by positive integers.
