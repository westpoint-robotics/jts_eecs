Pre-Tutorial
=================
-Since JTS moved to github the zip file needs to be downloaded(I advise this for simplicity), or you can clone the repository.
-the zip file from github is the source distribution. (4.1.8)
-The guide PDF is in the jaustoolset-master\jaustoolset-master\GUI\doc directory
-I have also amended the guide with inline comments which can be found in the outer jaustoolset-master directory

Tutorial
=================
Environment Setup
-------------------
-The tools underneath section 4.1.3 need to be installed and do not automatically install like the tools in section 3.2
-JDK(choose the most up to date one)
	--intstall a JDK if your computer does not have one, set JAVA_HOME environment variable to the jdk's directory. 
-apache ant 
	--Need to add two environment variables, ANT_HOME set to the directory of apache ant. Add %ANT_HOME%/bin to the end of your PATH environment variable. 
	--install using "build install", can check for install by running ant in a directory without a build.xml file and if installed should throw an error about the presence of a build.xml file.
-scons-2.5.0
	--the windows installer for scons failed after failing to find the python installation,so I used the scons-2.5.0 zip
	--downloaded the scons-2.5.0.zip file and ran setup.py install to install it
	--C:\Python27\ and C:\Python27\Scripts\ should be in your Path variable already, if they are not, add them or scons will not install. 
-Make sure Python 2.7 is installed on your computer.

-FOR WINDOWS-Microsoft visual studio c++ compiler(currently the 2010 and 2012 versions work, 2015 I have not gotten to work)

-NOTE:When auto generating code it is possible to build it as a Visual Studio Project(This helps show documentation of the classes/functions)
HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!^

-Section 4.1.8 should precede 4.1.6, do not begin enacting 4.1.6 until reading to 4.1.8.
-if you type ant and the error that appears is build.xml file doesnt exist, then apache ant is installed and you just need to traverse to the directory in the jaus toolset folder that has build.xml in it to run ant commands. 
-run ant schema-export to set up a clean copy of the db and then ant run to create the window, schema-export clears the JTS database of EVERYTHING, from components all the way down to the simple fields. 
-the same database is used so if you close out of JTS after running ant run, DO NOT run ant schema-export unless you want to clear out all of your previous work.
-one of the most common point of failures

Troubleshooting Examples
--------------------
-make sure that the system environment variable JTS_COMMON_PATH is set to C:\......\GUI\templates\Common in your jaustoolset-master directory.
-note that in most cases, the C++ compiler does not automatically install with Visual Studio, the lab computers should work though. 
-for section 7.3 spent hours troubleshooting issues with scons installation, had issues if it wasn't run from a visual studio command line to process certain commands, now stuck on a c1083 fatal error: cannot open source file. 
-the c1083 error came from a bad visual studio, 2010 on the lab computer works.
-if properly installed should be able to build files with scons without being in the visual studio command line. 
-if you try running scons and you get a 'cl' command cannot be found that means that you probably haven't installed the C++ compiler for visual studio. 
-note that it doesn't matter where the c++ code is generated but I generated it in the jaustoolset-master directory one level above GUI.
-in section 8.2 paragraph 8, it says 4202h for an id but means 4202, h is just to identify the number as hexadecimal.
-in section 8.3 paragraph 4. enter the text in the text editor window as written in the tutorial minus the quotations.
---in paragraph 6 just enter Ready into the text editor to name it, the name = format from before will not work.
---in paragraph 7 the automatic transition refers to the simple transition leading from the pseudo start state leading to Ready.
---refer to section 12.2 for a more in depth explanation of Behavior Elements
-note that the protocol behavior GUI is buggy
-also you will not be able to save a protocol behavior unless the FSM passes the validators tests and is saved as a .mxe file. 

C++ Conventions
==================================
-the double colon "::" is used as the scope operator, resolving the scope for the object(most likely a function) it operates on.
---therefore Animal::roar(); tells the compiler to look for the roar function within the Animal class. 
---most of the functions in the auto-generated code have the double colon, it is used by std as well for the cout function like std::cout

Other Examples
==================================
Environmental Sensing
-------------------------
-in jaustoolset-master\examples\StillImageServer_200 run scons to build
-in jaustoolset-master\examples\Java\StillImageClientComponent_220 run scons to build an executable jar in its bin folder.
---if you get an error saying javac can't be found then prepend your JAVA_HOME path to the bin to the Path variable ex: "JAVA_HOME path\bin; rest of the Path variables."
-then run nodeManager, the server, and client to finish the example.

Waypoint Driver
-------------------------
-ExampleOCU is is built from Java so the same precautions taken in the previous example apply.
-Build WayPoint Driver and ExampleOCU and run both after running the nodeManager. 
-Currently have a question in to Aaron Miycus at TARDEC about the resulting behavior/lack thereof.
-


Primitive Driver
======================================
-Since Primitive Driver inherits from services defined within the Core Service set, you must import the xml definitions of these services from 
jaustoolset-master\jaustoolset-master\GUI\resources\xml\urn.jaus.jss.core-v1.0
-the PrimitiveDriver xml can be found in urn.jaus.jss.mobility

-PrimitiveDriver inherits from Management
-Management inherits from AccessControl
-AccessControl inherits from Events
-Events inherits from Transport
-I also included the Discovery service, because it was used in the WaypointDriver example.
Analyzing the services that make up waypoint driver and primitive Driver
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-I looked through the auto generated code from my first attempt at PrimitiveDriver and compared that code to the auto generated and user modified code of the
waypoint driver example from the tutorial where the services are the same. 
-The files I compared were each services, _ReceiveFSM, _SendFSM, and <service name>Service.cpp.
-The services I looked at were Transport, Events, AccessControl, Management, Discovery, ListManager, LocalPoseServer, and LocalWaypointList.
-I found that with the exception of Transport, Events, and ListManager the _ReceiveFSM files were different when compared.
-I also found that the _SendFSM files were all identical when compared from the auto generated version to the version present in the example code. 
-The <...>Service.cpp files were all different and this was to be expected since they possess the logic that allows the program to make state transitions and therefore would be different since the FSM's are different. 


Functions that are not stubbed out in waypoint driver that are stubbed out in auto generated PrimDriver:

AccessControl_ReceiveFSM.cpp
-----------------------------
- defines 3 variables(1 is a pointer?)
---static JausAddress *currentController = NULL
---static unsigned char currentAuthority = 0
---static unsigned char defaultAuthority = 1 
-has sendAction(std::string arg0, std::string arg1, Receive::Body::ReceiveRec transportData)
-setAuthorityAction(RequestControl msg)
-StoreAddressAction(Receive::Body::ReceiveRec transportData)
-isControllingClient(Receive::Body::ReceiveRec transportData)
-isCurrentAuthority(RequestControl msg)
-isDefaultAuthorityGreater(RequestControl msg) 

Management_ReceiveFSM.cpp
--------------------------
-sendAction(std::string arg0, std::string arg1, Receive::Body::ReceiveRec transportData)
-initializeAction()
-isIDStored (Receive::Body::ReceiveRec transportData)

Discovery_ReceiveFSM.cpp
--------------------------
-instantiates a class, ServiceLocationList
-PublishServicesAction(RegisterServices msg,Receive::Body::ReceiveRec transportData)
-SendAction(std::string arg0,Receive::Body::ReceiveRec transportData) 

LocalPoseSensor_ReceiveFSM.cpp
-------------------------------
-sendAction(std::string arg0, std::string arg1, Receive::Body::ReceiveRec transportData)

LocalWaypointListDriver_ReceiveFSM.cpp 
---------------------------------------
-substantial number of variables and some logic not contained by a function near the top of the file.
-computeNextWrenchEffort, unique because this function does not exist in the autogenerated code, perhaps due to differences in the FSMs. 
-sendAction
-executeWaypointlistAction
-modifyTravelSpeedAction
-setElementAction
-elementExists
-elementSpecified
-isElementSupported
-wayPointExists
-isValidElementRequest

Iteration_1--code can be found in the github repository 
-----------------------
-I copied the user code from AccessControl, Management, and Discovery(From the waypoint driver example) into those same services in the PrimitiveDriver component. 
-I based the PrimitiveDriver_ReceiveFSM off of the WaypointListDriver_ReceiveFSM but made several changes.
-The sendAction function only needs to account for the condition that arg0 is equal to the string "ReportWrenchEffort",
it then gets the propulsivelineareffortX and the propulsivelineareffortY so that they can be printed so that the values can be monitored for errors by the developer.
I then send the message using sendJausMessage
-for the setWrenchEffortAction function, it uses the values from the incoming setWrenchEffort message as parameters to set the wrench effort.
-I had to create the PrimServer component from scratch to interface with the PDRobot.
-its message input and output sets are inverse to primitive Drivers, i.e. its inputs are the outputs of primitiveDrivers and vice versa. 
-its protocol behavior is similiar to that of the addition client in that it has one state, Ready with an entry condition and internal transition.
---the entry condition, called startService sends a single QueryWrenchEffort that prompts the ReportWrenchEffort message to be sent from the robot.
---However, since this condition runs immediately upon starting, you must run PrimitiveDriverRobot first otherwise it will not be able to send the ReportWrenchEffort message that initiates the loop.
---the internal transition on Ready consists of the trigger ReportWrenchEffort and the actions, setWrenchEffort, and QueryWrenchEffort. 
---if you do not want it to loop you can remove the QueryWrenchEffort action as it won't trigger the robot to send the report.  
---the code for the functions can be found in the github repository. 




Iteration_2
-------------------------
-reduce reliance on the entry condition to prompt the loop. 
--Have both the QueryWrenchEffort and StartService Action functions pause until user prompts an action, can do this with std::cin
----Did implement this functionality, is now present in the Iteration2 folder in the repository.
